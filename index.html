<p> I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in the
<a href=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/economics/index.page target="_blank">economics department</a>
at the <a href=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/economics/index.page target="_blank">University of Southampton</a>. I received my PhD from
<a href=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/ target="_blank">University College London</a>, under the supervision of
<a href="https://www.imranrasul.com/" target="_blank">Imran Rasul</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jeromeadda16/research" target="_blank">Jérôme Adda</a>.</p>
<p> My main research interest is in applied microeconomics. I am currently working on two main projects. One on ethnic differentials in criminal sentencing, and the other on marriage and labour market outcomes. In the past i've worked on several different projects related to education, an area in which I'm still interested.</p>

	<p>The notion of ingroup-outgroup biases can be extended to multi-identity societies, so social preference are defined over an ingroup and multiple outgroups. We use a quasi-experimental research design around 9-11 to recover the structure of social preferences across outgroups. In particular we investigate whether increased animosity towards Muslims post 9-11 had spillover effects on Black and Hispanic individuals in the context of the high stakes and professional environment of the Federal criminal justice system. Using linked administrative data tracking defendants from arrest through to sentencing, our core finding is that as 9-11 sparked a rise in animosity towards Muslims, sentence and pre-sentence outcomes for Hispanic defendants significantly worsened. The findings are in line with judges and prosecutors displaying social preferences characterized by contagious animosity from Muslims to Hispanics. To understand why increased animosity towards Muslims post 9-11 could spillover onto Hispanics, we draw on work in sociology to provide a detailed account of how Islamophobia and immigration have become gradually intertwined in American consciousness since the mid 1990s, but were most forcefully framed together in the aftermath of 9-11. We underpin a causal interpretation of our findings by providing evidence in favor of the identifying assumptions underlying our research design, and we narrow down the interpretation of the results using evidence from decomposition analysis, and correlating sentencing differentials to judge characteristics, including their race/ethnicity. Our findings provide among the first field evidence of contagious animosity, that social preferences across outgroups are interlinked and malleable to circumstances.</p>

	<p>In the federal criminal justice system (CJS), large Hispanic-white differences in sentencing outcomes exist. We examine the malleability of factors that drive such differences. To do so, we exploit 9-11 as an exogenously timed cue heightening the salience of insider-outsider divisions in American society, that might have impacted Hispanic defendants given long-standing interlinkages drawn between terrorism, border security and immigration. Exploiting linked administrative data covering criminal cases from arrest through to sentencing, we use a DiD research design based on defendants all of whom were arrested pre 9-11, but who came up for sentencing either side of 9-11. We find that among those sentenced post 9-11, Hispanic-white judicial sentencing differentials are exacerbated relative to these sentenced pre 9-11, while black-white sentencing differentials are unaffected. Our data and research design allows us to further document the differential treatment of Hispanic defendants by prosecutors in pre-sentencing stages of the CJS, such as with regards to the initial offense charges set. We use decomposition analysis to show the vast majority of sentencing differentials are driven by unobservables rather than sentencing prices on observables such as offense type or criminal history. Furthermore, we document that in districts with a higher proportion of Hispanic judges, Hispanic-white differentials are significantly reduced, consistent with judicial biases influencing decision making. Our results provide insights into the magnitude, channels and malleability of Hispanic-white sentencing differentials in the professional and high-stakes federal criminal justice system.</p>
